						<p>You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them 
							appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air 
							for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing 
							vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, 
							each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
						</p>
						<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet 
							to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another 
							light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the 
							spell's range.
