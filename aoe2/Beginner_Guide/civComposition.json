        "notes": "Aztecs have very strong Eagle Warriors with their unique technology Garland Wars giving all their infantry +4 attack. Eagle Warriors are fast raiding units that excel against ranged and siege units, however they fall flat against other melee units. That's where your Jaguar Warriors (anti-infantry) and Pikemen (anti-cavalry) come in."
