    <notes>Aztecs have very strong Eagle Warriors with their unique
    technology Garland Wars giving all their infantry +4 attack.
    Eagle Warriors are fast raiding units that excel against ranged
    and siege units, however they fall flat against other melee units.
    That's where your Jaguar Warriors (anti-infantry) and Pikemen
    (anti-cavalry) come in.</notes>

    <notes>Berbers have cheaper cavalry, so you should use this to your advantage. An army of 
    Cavaliers and Camels backed up by Skirmishers to take care of those pesky Halberdiers
    can go a long way.</notes>

    <notes>The Britons' claim to fame are their long-range archers, including their unique unit
    Longbowman and their Arbalests from the Archery Range. Light Cavalry to take care of enemy
    Skirmishers and Siege Units, and Halberdiers to take care of enemy Cavaliers/Paladins,
    which are the biggest counters to archers.</notes>
