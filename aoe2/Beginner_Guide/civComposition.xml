    <support>Jaguar Warriors (Castle), Pikemen (Barracks), Arbalests (Archery Range)</support>
    <notes>Aztecs have very strong Eagle Warriors with their unique
    technology Garland Wars giving all their infantry +4 attack.
    Eagle Warriors are fast raiding units that excel against ranged
    and siege units, however they fall flat against other melee units.
    That's where your Jaguar Warriors (anti-infantry) and Pikemen
    (anti-cavalry) come in.</notes>

    <support>Skirmishers (Archery Range)</support>
    <notes>Berbers have cheaper cavalry, so you should use this to your advantage. An army of 
    Cavaliers and Camels backed up by Skirmishers - to take care of those pesky Halberdiers -
     can go a long way.</notes>

    <support>Light Cavalry (Stables), Halberdiers (Barracks)</support>
    <notes>The Britons' claim to fame are their long-range archers, including their unique unit
    Longbowman and their Arbalests from the Archery Range. Light Cavalry to take care of enemy
    Skirmishers and Siege Units, and Halberdiers to take care of enemy Cavaliers/Paladins,
    which are the biggest counters to archers. Rain on 'em with your Longbowmen!</notes>

    <primary>Arambai (Castle) or Battle Elephants (Castles)</primary>
    <support>Skirmishers (Barracks), Halberdier (Barracks)</support>
    <notes>The Burmese has very good Battle Elephants. Their unique unitm, the Arambai, is very
    inaccurate at long range, so you have to put them very close (2 tiles away max) to the enemy
    to do damage. Since both the Arambai and the Battle Elephants are cavalry, the opposing
    civs will build Halberdiers and Camels to counter you. To kill Halberdiers, Skirmishers
    will do the trick. For Camels, your Halberdiers can take care of them.</notes>

    <name>Byzantines</name>
    <primary>Arbalests (Archery Range) or Cataphracts (Castle) or Paladins (Barracks)</primary>
    <support>Halberdiers (Barracks), Skirmishers (Archery Range), Camels (Stables),
    Hussars (Stables)</support>
    <notes>The Byzantines are kings of "trash" units, i.e. units that do not cost gold. These
    units are the Skirmishers, the Halberdiers, and the Hussar. Trash units for Byzantines
    cost less resources than other civs, except for Hussars.
    However, that means you should spend gold on more powerful units. The Byzantines unfortunately
    lack the final Melee Offensive upgrade at the Blacksmith (Blast Furnace), so their melee units
    deal less damage than other civs. The exception is their unique unit, the Cataphracts. The
    Cataphracts deal area of effect damage once the Imperial tech Logistica is researched at the
    Castle, meaning for every attack they will do an extra 5 damage to any nearby units. Cataphracts
    also deal bonus damage to infantry. The Byzantines also get fully upgraded Arbalests, so their
    Archery range units are strong. Combined either Arbalests and Cataphracts with their cheaper
    trash units as supporting units and the Byzantines can have a formidable military force.</notes>

    <name>Celts</name>
    <primary>Scorpions (Siege Workshop)</primary>
    <support>Halberdiers (Barracks), Woad Raider (Castle)</support>
    <notes>The Celts excel in Siege Workshop units, particularly the Scorpions and the Onagers.
    Onagers can do friendly fire damage though, thus they are a bit harder to use than
    Scorpions. Siege Workshops shred through archers and skirmishers, but they struggle against
    melee and other siege units. To take care of that, the Halberdiers can deal with any
    cavalry trying to get to your siege units, while the Woad Raiders can take care of opposing
    siege units.</notes>

    <name>Chinese</name>
    <primary>Chu Ko Nu (Castle) or Scorpions (Siege Workshop)</primary>
    <support>Light Cavalry (Stables), Halberdiers (Barracks), Camels (Stables)</support>
    <notes>The Chinese have very good unique units in the Chu Ko Nu. They have less range than
    other archers, but they do significantly more damage, even to high pierce armor targets
    such as Rams. However, siege units such as Onagers will still pose a threat to the 
    low melee armored Chu Ko Nus. To kill siege units, go for Light Cavalry. To kill any
    cavalry that's trying to get to your archers, go for Halberdiers and Camels.</notes>

    <primary>Arbalests (Archery Range), Scorpions (Siege Workshop)</primary>
    <support>Halberdiers (Barracks), Hussars (Stables), Shotel Warrior (Castle)</support>
    <notes>Ethiopians have faster firing archers, thus you can use this advantage by making
    lots of archers. They also have very strong Siege units with their Imperial unique tech,
    Torsion Engine. You should have Hussars in front of your archers and siege units as a
    meat shield, while having Halberdiers to deal with any incoming Cavalry. Shotel Warriors
    get created very quickly, thus they can be used to defend against opposing Rams, 
    Skirmishers, and Halberdiers.</notes>

    <name>Franks</name>
    <primary>Paladins (Stables)</primary>
    <support>Skirmishers (Archery Range), Halberdiers (Barracks), Throwing Axeman (Castle)</support>
    <notes>The Franks have one good unit, and that is the Paladin. Granted, they have the best
    Paladins in the game, so that should be something. They also get free Mill farm upgrades, so
    their Farms are very good (not as good as Slavs though). Paladins' biggest counters are
    Halberdiers and Camels. To take care of Halberdiers, go for Skirmishers. Your own Halberdiers
    take care of opposing Camels. However, your Skirmishers lack the final archer upgrades 
    in the Blacksmith, so they are not too strong. To combat this, if you have any extra gold,
    consider building Throwing Axemen to counter the Halberdiers.</notes>

    <name>Goths</name>
    <primary>Huskarls (Castles and Barracks once Anarchy is researched)</primary>
    <support>Halberdiers (Barracks), Hussars (Stables)</support>
    <notes>The Goths have the best infantry in the game because their infantry is cheaper and their
    Barracks work faster, especially after their Imperial tech Perfusion is researched. The
    Huskarls, their unique unit, can be created from the Goths' Barracks after their Castle Age tech
    Anarchy is researched. The Huskarls have very high pierce armor, making them excellent
    against archers and Scorpions. Huskarls are weak against cavalry and onagers. Halberdiers
    can handle cavalry, while the Hussars can handle onagers.</notes>

    <name>Huns</name>
    <primary>Paladins (Stables) or Cavalry Archer (Archery Range)</primary>
    <support>Skirmishers (Archery Range), Hussars (Stables), Halberdiers (Barracks)</support>
    <notes>The Huns are a very aggressive civ, simply because they do not have to waste early
    resources on building houses. They have a great Stable, with their Stables working 20% faster.
    They also have cheaper Cavalry Archers if you opt to use them as the backbone of your
    military. If you opt to go for Paladins, go for Skirmishers to kill off the pesky Halberdiers.
    If you want to build Cavalry Archers, build some Hussars to take care of skirmishers and 
    siege. If you see opposing Camels, start making Halberdiers.</notes>

    <primary>Kamayuk (Castle) or Eagle Warriors (Barracks)</primary>
    <support>Halberdiers (Barracks), Arbalests (Archery Range), Skirmishers (Archery Range)</support>
    <notes>Similar to the Aztes, the Incas are a Meso civ with strong infantry units. Their unique
    unit, the Kamayuk, is anti-cavalry, so if you build them you don't have to build any additional
    Halberdiers. Kamayuks are weak against opposing infantry and archers, so consider building
    Arbalests to kill infantry and Skirmishers to kill archers. </notes>

    <name>Indians</name>
    <primary>Imperial Camel (Stables)</primary>
    <support>Skirmishers (Archery Range), Hand Cannoneer (Archery Range after Chemistry is
    researched at the University)</support>
    <notes>The Indians have one of the best camels in the game, them being the Imperial Camels.
    Camels are anti-cavalry, and Indian Camels are especially tanky thanks to their +1 Melee/
    +1 Pierce armor. Camels are weak against Archers and Halberdiers, both units that Skirmishers can
    counter. In the late game, Hand Cannoneer can also be used against Halberdiers since Hand
    Cannoneers get +10 attack against infantry.</notes>

    <name>Italians</name>
    <primary>Genoese Crossbowman (Castles)</primary>
    <support>Hussars (Stables)</support>
    <notes>The Italians have a great unique unit in the Genoese Crossbowman since these archers
    are anti-cavalry, thus they innately counter one of the archers' weakness. However, they are
    still weak to Skirmishers and Siege units, where you can use the Hussars to counter.</notes>

    <name>Japanese</name>
    <primary>Arbalests (Archery Range) or Samurai (Castles), Trebuchets (Castles)</primary>
    <support>Light Cavalry (Stables), Halberdiers (Barracks), Skirmishers (Archery Range),
    Scorpions (Siege Workshop)</support>
    <notes>The Japanese have very great infantry (infantry attacks faster) and a complete
    Archery Range. They also have a complete Blacksmith tree, so any units they go for can be fully
    upgraded at the Blacksmith. Furthermore, they also have a complete Barracks, save for the
    Meso-only Eagle Warriors. Thus, you can either go for an army of mass Arbalests combined with
    Halberdiers and Light Cav, or you can go for Samurai (anti-unique unit), Halberdiers and
    Skirmishers, depending on the opposing army composition. If you have spare gold in the end
    game, Heavy Scorpions are also a good choice to counter opposing Archers. Lastly, the Japanes
    Trebuchets packs and unpacks faster, thus you can destroy a castle, pack your Trebuchet,
    and move it to destroy the next building much faster than any other civ.</notes>
