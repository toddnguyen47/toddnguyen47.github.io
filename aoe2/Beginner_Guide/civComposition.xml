    <notes>Aztecs have very strong Eagle Warriors with their unique
    technology Garland Wars giving all their infantry +4 attack.
    Eagle Warriors are fast raiding units that excel against ranged
    and siege units, however they fall flat against other melee units.
    That's where your Jaguar Warriors (anti-infantry) and Pikemen
    (anti-cavalry) come in.</notes>
