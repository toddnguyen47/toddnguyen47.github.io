      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my beginner's guide to Age of Empires 2 (AOE2)! I'll try to make this
        as brief as possible so you can read this ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>The general layout of this guide is that per age, I will list the total number of
        villagers as well as what each villagers should be working on. Economy is a vital
        part of this game, and it is the thing that beginners should work on first.
        Once you have a strong economy, you'll be able to fuel a strong military.
      </p>
      <p>Military compositions will depend on the civilization. I will list what I think
        is the best military composition for each civ after the advanced tips.
      </p>
      <p>Also, always remember to build <strong>houses</strong>, otherwise you won't be able to create
        new villagers/units! The only exception is when you hit the population cap
        for the game, which is usually 200.
      </p>

      <h3>Civilization Choices</h3>
      <p>I do not recommend the Huns or Chinese for new players as they have
        a bit of a peculiar start. Any other civilizatiosn are strong in their own way
        and can be picked!
      </p>

      <h2 id="usefulHotkeys">USEFUL HOTKEYS</h2>
      <p>Since this is a real time strategy game, hotkeys will be vital to your gameplay
        as you don't want to have to manually click on everything. However, the sheer
        number of hotkeys can be overwhelming, so I'll just list the most useful ones
        here first.
      </p>
      <table class="table table-hover table-bordered">
        <thead class="thead-dark">
          <tr>

          <tr>
            <td>H</td>
            <td>Jump to your Town Center. Very useful for creating villagers, as you can
              simply spam H -> AAA (A is the default for creating Town Centers).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Ctrl 1, Ctrl 2, etc. all the way to Ctrl 9</td>
            <td>Control Group, or assign units/buildings to a certain number. For example,
              you can assign your Scout to the key 1 by selecting on your Scout and press
              Ctrl 1. You can also assign buildings for quick unit creation. For example,
              I like to assign all my Stables to 6 (Ctrl 6), then once I press 6 I can quickly
              jump to all my stables and create all the Knights I want.

          <tr>
            <td>1, 2, 3, ..., to 9</td>
            <td>Quickly jump to your Control groups. If you press 1 once, the camera won't
              immediately "jump" to your unit/building. If you press 1 twice in quick
              succession, the camera will immediately jump to where your units/buildings 
              are. Also, for buildings, if you press their Control Group once and then
              you right click, you will set a <strong>Garrison Point</strong>. This means
              that all units created from these buildings will gather at the Garrison Point.
              This is an easy way to collect all your units together in one place!

          <li>If you are playing an Archer civ, build a University and get Ballistics ASAP</li>

            for your respective troops. For melee units, get the armor upgrades first.
            For ranged units, get the range + attack ugprades first.

          <li>Start making <strong>Trade Carts</strong> at the Market so you'll have a reliable source

      <h2 id="advancedTips">ADVANCED TIPS</h2>
      Some advanced tips:
      <ul>
        <!--Hotkeys Advanced Tips-->
        <li>Hotkeys are, by default, a grid setting. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>Economic Buildings:
              <p>
                <a href="images/aoe2_econ.png" target="_blank">
                  <img src="images/aoe2_econ.png" class="scaleToScreen"
                  alt="AOE2 Economy Buildings Hotkeys" />
                </a>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Military Buildings:
              <p>
                <a href="images/aoe2_military.png" target="_blank">
                  <img src="images/aoe2_military.png" class="scaleToScreen" 
                  alt="AOE2 Military Buildings Hotkeys"/>
                </a>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Military Units, e.g. Stables
              <p>
                <a href="images/aoe2_stables.png" target="_blank">
                  <img src="images/aoe2_stables.png" class="scaleToScreen" 
                  alt="AOE2 Stable Units Hotkeys"/>
                </a>
              </p>
              <p>Note that technologies, such as the Hussar upgrade (bottom left of
                the above picture) have no hotkey. You have to manually click on
                technologies, unfortunately.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <!--Boar Luring-->
        <li>To lure boar, use a villager to attack the boar twice. After that, move the
          villager back to your town center and garrison him/her (select your luring villager,
          press G, then left click the town center) and have 4-5 villagers shoot the boar.
          Remember to ungarrison your luring villager!
          <ul>
            <li>Video of this being done: Click <a href="https://streamable.com/fba4c" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <!--Fast Castle Build Order-->
        <li id="fastCastle">If you want a build order for a <strong>Fast Castle</strong> (less than 18 min)
          and then into knights, here it is. The general consensus is that you'll click up
          to Feudal Age at 28 total population, and Castle Age at 30 total population.
          <ul>
            <li>Build 2 houses with your initial 3 villagers. Have your Town Center
              create 4 villagers. 4/15 pop.
            </li>
            <li>First 6 villagers on sheep. 7/15 pop.</li>
            <li>Next 4 on wood. 11/15 pop.</li>
            <li>11th villager lure boar. 12/15 pop.</li>
            <li>12th villager build a house and a mill next to the berries. 13/20 pop.</li>
            <li>Next 4 villagers on sheep. Start luring your 2nd boar. 17/20 pop.</li>
            <li>Next 4 villagers on wood. Build 2 more houses. 21/30 pop.</li>
            <li>Next 2 villagers go to berries. Make farms as needed. 23/30 pop.</li>
            <li>Next 3 villagers go to gold. 26/30 pop.</li>
            <li>Next 2 villagers to go wood. 28/30 pop.</li>
            <li>Click up to Feudal Age.</li>
            <li>While you're advancing, build a Barracks. Start walling if needed.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In Feudal Age, build a Stable with 2 wood villagers (lumberjacks) and a
              Blacksmith with 1 wood villager.
            </li>
            <li>Create 2 more Villagers. Send them to wood. 30/30 pop.</li>
            <li>Once your TC (Town Center) finishes creating the 2 villagers, your
              buildings should be finished. Click up to Castle Age.
            </li>
            <li>Get the Lumber Camp upgrade, then the Mill upgrade.</li>
            <li>Once your berries and sheep run out, make farms.</li>
            <li>Build houses as needed.</li>
            <li>Build another Stable. Set both Stables to a control group (e.g. 6)</li>
            <li>Get the armor upgrades from the Blacksmith.</li>
            <li>If you have the resources for it, get Bloodlines at the stables.</li>
            <li>Once you finish advancing to Castle Age, immediately start making knights.
              This can be done via hotkeys by going to your control group and spamming S.
              E.g., 6 -> SSSS.
            </li>
            <li>Remember to always create villagers at your TC! Build more TCs when you
              think it is safe to do so.
