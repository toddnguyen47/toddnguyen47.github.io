    <!-- Overview -->
    <div id="overviewDiv">
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      While the Age of Empires II game works fine on Steam, there are some improvements that 
      can be done by installing the Wololol Kingdoms. A few examples of these improvements include:
      <ul>
        <li>Gates that can be rotated using the mouse wheel</li>
        <li>More responsive "Patrol" attacking option, thus allowing melee military units to
          intelligently target enemies instead of standing idle.
        </li>
        <li>More intelligent AI, such as Barbarian AI, can only be played on Wololol Kingdoms</li>
        <li>Competitive AoE II is played on Wololol Kingdoms.</li>
      </ul>

      Unfortunately, the Wololol Kingdoms mod can only be played on another game client called
      Voobly, and installing the mod itself requires a bit of a setup. No fear though! That's
      why this guide is here. I will show you how to install Wololol Kingdoms and Voobly!
    </div>
    <hr />

    <!-- Requirements -->
    <div id="requirementsDiv">
      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      You need to have purchased at least the Forgotten Empires expansion. The best-case scenario
      is if you own all 3 expansions - Forgotten Empires, African Kingdoms, and Rise of the Rajas.
    </div>

    <!-- Step-by-step guide -->
    <div id="stepByStepInstrDiv" class="customBotTopMargin">
      <h1>Wololol Kingdoms - Setup Instructions</h1>
      <!-- Step 1 -->
      <div id="wkStep1Div">
        <h2>Step 1:</h2>
        Make sure that you have installed Age of Empires II on Steam. After you installed AoE II,
        keep Steam open! Do not close the Steam client.
      </div>

      <!-- Step 2 -->
      <div id="wkStep2Div" class="customBotTopMargin">
        <h2>Step 2:</h2>
        Install the compatibility patch so you can run AoE II on Voobly. Download and install
        from the link below. Note that this link is my own Google Drive hosted link, as I
        do not trust the current host website that much. Download the file
        "Age2HDCompatibilityPatchV5.7z"
        <div>
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wt3T3mNRzze0nKxTX_H0wlh8WkNjQwAV?usp=sharig"
          target="_blank">
            https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/...
          </a>
        </div>
        When you install the compatibility patch, if an error that says "installation not detected"
        pops up, do not worry! Keep going with the installation, and make sure you have the path
        to the directory where you installed Age of Empires 2. It is usually where you installed
        your Steam, e.g. <span class="lightGrayBackground">Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD.</span>
        For example, my path is "Z:\Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD"
      </div>

      <!-- Step 3 -->
      <div id="wkStep3Div" class="customBotTopMargin">
        <h2>Step 3:</h2>
        Download and Install Voobly. Voobly can be found here:
        <div><a href="https://www.voobly.com/" target="_blank">https://www.voobly.com/</a></div>
        You'll also need to register for a Voobly account.
      </div>

      <!-- Step 4 -->
      <div id="wkStep4Div" class="customBotTopMargin">
        <h2>Step 4:</h2>
        Install "User Patch 1.5" by clicking on the link below and clicking on "Download Now."
        Your browser will ask if Voobly can be opened, which you shoud allow.
        <div>
          <a href="https://www.voobly.com/gamemods/mod/631/v15-Beta-R7" target="_blank">
            https://www.voobly.com/gamemods/mod/631/v15-Beta-R7
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 5 -->
      <div id="wkStep5Div" class="customBotTopMargin">
        <h2>Step 5:</h2>
        Install "WolololKingdoms" by going here and downloading the most recent ".exe" file.
        E.g. if the most recent version is 5.8.1, download the file "WololoKingdoms.5.8.1.exe"
        <div>
          <a href="https://github.com/AoE2CommunityGitHub/WololoKingdoms/releases" target="_blank">
            https://github.com/AoE2CommunityGitHub/WololoKingdoms/releases
          </a>
        </div>
        After installing WololoKingdoms, run the WololoKingdoms Converter.

        <!-- WK Updater Tool-->
        <div id="wkupdaterDiv" class="customLeftMargin">
          <!-- Step 5A -->
          <div id="step5ADiv">
            <h3>Step 5A:</h3>
            At the WK Updater, ensure that "Checking Permissions" and "Checking Updates" are both
            checked. Click "Update."
          </div>

          <!-- Step 5B -->
          <div id="step5BDiv">
            <h3>Step 5B</h3>
            <div>At the main WololoKingdom Updater screen, you can leave all the default settings alone.
            The only setting you have to change is "Choose which hotkeys to use." If you want to
            keep your current Steam hotkeys, choose the option "Use current AoC/Voobly hotkeys."</div>
            <div><strong>NOTE:</strong> Control group custom hotkeys do not currently work on 
            WololoKingdoms! In other words, control groups can only be set via the default
            Ctrl 1 - Ctrl 9, and the control groups can only be accessed via the default 1 - 9.
            If you want to make sure your hotkeys work, go into 
            <span class="lightGrayBackground">"Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD\profiles"</span> 
            and copy <span class="lightGrayBackground">"player0.hki"</span>. After that, go back
            into <span class="lightGrayBackground">"Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD"</span> and
            paste in <span class="lightGrayBackground">"player0.hki"</span>. Change the name of the
            newly pasted <span class="lightGrayBackground">"player0.hki"</span> file to
            <span class="lightGrayBackground">"player1.hki"</span></div>

            Click "Run" once you finish setting up everything.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 6 -->
      <div id="wkStep6Div" class="customBotTopMargin">
        <h2>Step 6</h2>
        Now we'll set up some Voobly settings.
        
        <div id="vooblySetup" class="customLeftMargin">
          <!-- Step 6A -->
          <div id="vooblySetupStep6A">
            <h3>Step 6A:</h3>
            After you open up Voobly, go to
            <span class="lightGrayBackground">File</span> &rarr; 
            <span class="lightGrayBackground">Game Browser</span>. In the newly opened Game Browser
            window, under <span class="lightGrayBackground">Age of Empires II: The Conquerors</span>,
            double click on <span class="lightGrayBackground">New Player Lobby</span>. Install any
            additional programs that Voobly requires. Once the New Player Lobby opens, if Voobly
            asks your permission to install any additional files, allow it to. Don't worry,
            this is completely safe!
          </div>

          <!-- Step 6B -->
          <div id="vooblySetupStep6B">
            <h3>Step 6B:</h3>
            Now, host a sample game and see if you can run WololoKingdoms. To do that, go Into
            the New Player Lobby, click on <span class="lightGrayBackground">File</span> &rarr;
            <span class="lightGrayBackground">Host Game</span>. After the hosted game pops up,
            click on <span class="lightGrayBackground">Settings</span>, and make sure it is 
            identical to the following image:
            <div><img src="images/VooblySetup1.png" class="scaleToScreen" /></div>
            Click "OK" once you are finished.
          </div>

          <!-- Step 6C -->
          <div id="vooblySetupStep6C">
            <h3>Step 6C:</h3>
            Now we are going to setup some resolution settings. Follow the images below:
            <div><img src="images/VooblySetup2.png" class="scaleToScreen"></div>
            <div><img src="images/VooblySetup3.png" class="scaleToScreen"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 7 -->
      <div id="wkStep7Div" class="customBotTopMargin">
        <h2>Step 7:</h2>
        If you set up everything correctly, the game should launch! In the game room, press the
        green "Launch" button. Once the game launches, make sure you change from "SQ" (Single
        Queue) to "MQ" (Multiple Queue). This means that if you have MQ and you select multiple
        military buildings, such as Stables, and build 10 knights, the 10 knights will be
        evenly divided for the selected Stables.
        <div><img src="images/MultiQueue.png" class="scaleToScreen" /></div>
      </div>

      You're done! Enjoy WololoKingdoms :) Make sure to support all the developers involved,
